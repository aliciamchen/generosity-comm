    <p>
    In this survey, you will read about <strong>${fetchTrialParams(condition_number).length}</strong> scenarios, each one describing a social interaction between two people.
    </p>
    <p>
    For each scenario, we will <strong>ask you about what is likely to happen the next time the social interaction occurs.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    You will see three choices for each scenario and be asked to rate how likely each choice is. Please consider each choice <strong>independently</strong> from the other two choices.
